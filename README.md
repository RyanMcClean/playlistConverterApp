This is a personal attempt to make a more complex playlist converter, over my last attempt.

This utilises the Spotify API to gain access to playlists, it saves those playlists as text files.
These text files are then used to make .m3u playlist files, this was initially for compatibility with iTunes and use on a modded iPod classic.
I have since added a Plex integration and now the playlists are shared with a plex library.
